## User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic MCP Interaction

**US1.1**: As a developer, I want to connect to my MCP server using simple commands so that I can start working quickly.
```
GIVEN I have the MCP server URL and credentials
WHEN I run `mcp-agent start`
THEN I should be connected and see a confirmation message
```
